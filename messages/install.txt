Thanks for installing Ruby on Rails Snippets

Package Controll installs the new snippets alongside the default, outdated ones provided by Sublime Text. If you'd like to completely replace the old snippets, follow installation via git instructions in the readme:

 FUTURE OF THIS PACKAGE
=========================

I'll be porting the changes in this package to the official Sublime Text Rails snippets.

If you want to make Sublime awesome for Rails again, join the effort:
